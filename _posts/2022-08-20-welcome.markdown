Hi everyone, nice to meet you! 😀

My name is Hyejun Oh. And I'm Mechanical Engineer, Data Scientiest, and Photographer! 👨‍💻 💻 📸

Currently, I am a master's student👨‍🎓 of Mechanical Engineering at Seoul National University.  
My research focus is on Prognostic Health Management (PHM) which is a field of diagnosing abnormalities in machine facilities using artificial intelligence.

This blog will cover practice on machine learning, deep learning, and statistics, and will review papers in the field of deep learning that I am currently studying.
And also i will present some of my scientific research and write about things that i find interesting,mostly related to data science.
